## Flood Mapping & Impact Assessment (GEE)  WadMadani,Sudan

This project uses Sentinel-1 SAR data to detect floods and assess their impact on people, agriculture, and urban areas within a specific region in WadMadani,Sudan. It incorporates historical rainfall trends, population density, and land use data to analyze flood consequences.

## Key Features  
- **Flood Detection**: Sentinel-1 SAR data identifies flood extents through backscatter analysis and filtering.  
- **Impact Assessment**: Analyzes population exposure (GHSL 2015), cropland inundation (UMD 2019), and urban flooding (JRC Built-Up Areas).  
- **Rainfall Trends**: Evaluates historical rainfall data from CHIRPS.  
- **Export Options**: Download results in GeoTIFF or Shapefile format.  
- **Interactive Map**: Provides flood map layers, population, and agricultural impact details.

> **Note**: This script focuses on flood impact analysis in specific regions and is designed for rapid assessments, not operational emergency response.
